GENERAL RANDOM ACRONYM LICENSE

Coded By Klem (klem86@gmail.com) Due to functional need of HansSkulzer (goliwaug@yahoo.fr)
Chat messages interceptor based on the interception of server-pushed JSON files used for the GUI updates
of Minecraft's DynMap plugin.
No "cracking" or security breach where employed during the development process.
All the intercepted messages are publicly accessible via any internet browser.

Made specifically for the following server 
http://hfrcraft.deepdark.fr/dynmap

compatibility with other servers is unknown and not really cared about

-Have fun with it
-Don't sell it
-Let me know if you like it
-Let me know if you want improvements
-If you are a dev, check out the source, feedback is always appreciated
-Thank you is always nice and it's still free
-You can redistribute freely, by any mean, just keep this license within the distribution.
-Again, don't make a freaking dime out of it or I'll sue your ass so hard you'll shit bricks.
-Don't blame me if it suddenly stops working. I just reversed engineered 
some of the whole server side stuff to make this work. If anything change I'm screwed.
